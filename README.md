# STM32_uart_terminal - Attention! Now isn't working! 
Testing serial (TTL) communication without a PC.

## Idea
I want to create a device for serial communication testing with using the STM32F1 board (Blue Pill), the 2.4" SPI TFT display and the membrane keypad.

## Planned features
- Display of serial communication in ascii or dec mode.
- Changing the communication speed without program editing.
- Move the display up and down.
- Battery power and galvanically isolated inputs(Rx) and outputs(Tx).
- The ability to enter and send serial data.
